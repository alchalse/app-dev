      My favorite movie is the South Korean film *Parasite* directed by *Bong Joon Ho*. 
      It is a comedy thriller :joy: :knife: that brings light to the huge divide between the upper class and the lower class. 
      This film is recognized worldwide for its gripping cinematography and incredible story telling.  
**_Parasite_ has everything that anyone who enjoys movies would like:**
- [X] Action
- [X] Comedy
- [X] Thrill
- [X] Family-Values
- [X] Class Consciousness
- [X] and Depression

> [!CAUTION]
> Before watching though, it is important that you are in a good mental state as this movie is a rollercoaster experience and may cause severe emotional turmoil.
